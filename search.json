    "section": "",
    "text": "At the turn of last year and this year, millions of fans around the world heard on Sky Sports broadcast: “Triple twenty will leave him double ten. And he finishes it on double ten! Luke Littler by name, but right now arguably the biggest name in the world of darts. Littler takes the giant step into the World Championship final. He made it nineteen days shy of his 17th birthday, and tomorrow he could be the World Darts Champion!”\nThe entire world of darts learned to count on a new rising star. Luke Littler made it to the World Championship final at the age of 16. He had to go through all of the rounds to reach the finals as he was not seeded due to his position in the world rankings.\nThe youngster, with the nickname “The Nuke”, was already good before the World Championship, and he continues to be in great form. Data from the end of March 2023 to the end of March 2024, that compare him with the 112 best players in the world, show how good he actually was.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nplayers &lt;- read_csv(\"DartsFinalData2.csv\")\n\nnew_top&lt;- players |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Played &gt;= 126 &\n      AVG &gt; 90 &\n      Pct_Legs_Won_Throwing_first &gt; 60 &\n      Pct_Legs_Won_Throwing_second &gt; 40\n  ) \n\nlittler &lt;- new_top |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Player == \"Luke Littler\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=new_top, \n    aes(y=reorder(Player, Pct_Legs_Won_Throwing_first), x=Pct_Legs_Won_Throwing_second, xend= Pct_Legs_Won_Throwing_first),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"lightgrey\",\n    colour_x = \"blue\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=littler, \n    aes(y=reorder(Player, Pct_Legs_Won_Throwing_first), x=Pct_Legs_Won_Throwing_second, xend= Pct_Legs_Won_Throwing_first),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"darkgrey\",\n    colour_x = \"blue\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title=\"Littler dominates legs throwing both first and second\", \n    subtitle = \" Among those who played more than the median of matches and had an average higher than 90, 'The Nuke' was the best when throwing  &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; and the second best when throwing &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;.\", y= \"Player\", x = \"Percentage of leg wins\", caption=\"Source: Darts Orakel | By Jiri Vokral\"\n  ) + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8.5), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe won more than 77 percent of those legs. That’s five percentage points more than world number one Luke Humphries and six more than three-time world champion and world number two Michael van Gerwen. Littler’s success rate dropped to 52.67 percent on the occasions when he went to the dartboard second. However, that is still the second-best result of all the players.\n“The Nuke” sent one opponent after another home at the World Championship. When he faced the legendary Raymond van Barneveld in the round of sixteen, the pundits didn’t give Littler much of a chance. But they were wrong. Littler defeated the former world number one and world champion 4:1.\nEven Brendan Dolan and world number eight and former world champion Rob Cross couldn’t send him home.\nLittler led 4:2 in the final. He became the darling of the fans, who chanted, “You’ve got school in the morning, school in the morning!”\nBut in the end, Luke Humphries turned the dramatic finals around and became the world champion and world number one. But Littler’s performance earned him an invitation to Premier League Darts, a select company of the best darts players who would meet in fifteen tournaments throughout the spring.\nIn eleven tournaments so far, he has reached the finals four times and won twice. As a result, Littler currently leads the overall standings in the highly prestigious Premier League.\nSo, is “The Nuke” the best player in the world right now?\n“No. No way,” Littler said when he was asked this question after one of the matches at the World Championship. “You still got Luke Humphries in there, you still got Michael van Gerwen in there. I’m one of the best right now in terms of performance, but I’m not the best in the world,” he added.\nWell.\nLittler had the highest winning percentage during the whole year. He played a total of 398 games (by far the most of all players, the second-highest result is 339), of which he won 333. This means that he won more than 83 percent of all his games (median among players who had average higher than 92 and won more than 60 percent of their games was 64.2 percent).\n\n\nCode\nbubble &lt;- read_csv(\"DartsFinalData2.csv\")\n\nnew_bubble &lt;- bubble [-56,]|&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Win_Pct = (Won/Played)*100\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(\n    AVG &gt; 92,\n    Win_Pct &gt; 60\n  ) \n\nluke_littler &lt;- new_bubble |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Player == \"Luke Littler\"\n  )\n\nbubble_top &lt;- new_bubble |&gt;\n  filter(\n    AVG &gt; 98 &\n      First_9_averages &gt; 107\n  )\n    \nbubble_top2 &lt;- new_bubble |&gt;\n  filter(\n    AVG &gt; 94.695 &\n      First_9_averages &gt; 103.7 &\n      Win_Pct &gt; 64.22764    \n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=new_bubble, \n    aes(x=First_9_averages, y=AVG, size= Win_Pct),\n    color = \"grey\",\n    alpha=.8\n    ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=luke_littler, \n    aes(x=First_9_averages, y=AVG, size= Win_Pct),\n    color = \"red\"\n    ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=bubble_top2, \n    aes(x=First_9_averages, y=AVG, size= Win_Pct),\n    color = \"blue\",\n    alpha=.8\n    ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(100,110)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits =c(90,102.5)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 103.64) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 94.61 ) +\n  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1,10), name = \"Share of games \\nwon (in %)\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=luke_littler, \n    aes(x=First_9_averages, y=AVG, label=Player), nudge_y = 1, nudge_x = .3) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=bubble_top2, \n    aes(x=First_9_averages, y=AVG, label=Player), nudge_y = .72, nudge_x = -1.4, size=3.4) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   labs(\n    title=\"Littler wins the most games even without the highest averages\", \n    subtitle = \"Unlike players in &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;, 'The Nuke' is not above median in all three stats.

Prior to this tournament, he had been hovering on the fringes of PDC and junior events. For example, he took over the final of the 2023 PDC World Youth Championships and defeated Gian van Veen 6:4 in sets.\nMedia refers to Littler also as “180’s machine”. He had most of them thrown (869) in the past 12 months. “The Nuke” also played the most games of any of the top 112 players in the world.\n\n\nCode\nscatter &lt;- read_csv(\"DartsFinalData2.csv\")|&gt;\n  filter(\n    Played &gt; 100\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Hundreds_plus = `100+_averages_percentage`,\n    Maxs_per_match = `180's`/Played\n  )\n\nluke_littler_scatter &lt;- scatter |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Player == \"Luke Littler\"\n  )\n\nscatter_top &lt;- scatter |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Maxs_per_match &gt; 3.2 &\n      Hundreds_plus &gt; 27\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=scatter, aes(x=Maxs_per_match, y=Hundreds_plus), color=\"grey\", alpha=.5) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=luke_littler_scatter, \n    aes(x=Maxs_per_match, y=Hundreds_plus), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=scatter_top, \n    aes(x=Maxs_per_match, y=Hundreds_plus), \n    color=\"blue\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,5)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits =c(0,60)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1.714514) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 7.245) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=luke_littler_scatter, \n    aes(x=Maxs_per_match, y=Hundreds_plus, label=Player), nudge_x = .4, size=4\n  ) +\n   geom_text_repel(\n    data=scatter_top, \n    aes(x=Maxs_per_match, y=Hundreds_plus, label=Player), nudge_x = .4, size=4) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   labs(\n    title=\"World Champions Humpries and Anderson consistently scored the highest\", \n    subtitle = \"Littler could not get close to the &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;best ones&lt;/span&gt; in both number of matches with 100+ average and scored maximums per match.

Luke Humphries managed to score more than 4 per game.\nLittler managed hit an average of more than 100 points in 22 percent of his matches. Two-time world champion Anderson did it in 45.59 percent of his games, and the oft-mentioned Humphries in almost 45 percent.\nIn both stats, Littler is above the median, but well behind the best players.\nWhat still significantly drags down Littler is his checkout success rate. Any player can close his leg by scoring the appropriate double. For instance, if a player has 40 left, he can close the leg with a double 20.\n\n\nCode\nbar &lt;- read_csv(\"DartsFinalData2.csv\")\n\ntop_bar_players &lt;- c(\"Luke Humphries\", \"Michael van Gerwen\", \"Michael Smith\", \"Nathan Aspinall\", \"Gerwyn Price\", \"Rob Cross\", \"Dave Chisnall\", \"Peter Wright\", \"Dimitri Van den Bergh\", \"Damon Heta\", \"Luke Littler\")\n\nnew_bar &lt;- bar |&gt; \n  filter(Player %in% top_bar_players) |&gt; \n  select(Player, Checkout_Pct)\n\ntop_bar &lt;- new_bar [-7,] \n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=top_bar, aes(x=reorder(Player, Checkout_Pct), weight=Checkout_Pct), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=luke_littler, aes(x=reorder(Player, Checkout_Pct), weight=Checkout_Pct), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   labs(\n    title=\"'The Nuke' should work on doubles this year\", \n    subtitle = \"Checkouts went pretty well for Littler, but he's trailing the best five.

A little bit, yes, but more like no.\nSome of his stats are quite breathtaking, especially considering his age and lack of experience. In other stats he is close to the best players in the world, but still behind them.\nThe next twelve months, when “The Nuke” will be competing against the best regularly, will tell us more. The 17-year-old Englishman is proving just what he is capable of in this year’s Premier League Darts…"

    "title": "This could be the worst Chelsea season in the Premier League history",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It was May 29, 2021. The world was still fighting a coronavirus pandemic that affected the football world. Half-empty stands in Porto, Portugal, watched the final of the world’s most prestigious club football competition, the Champions League.\nTwo English teams clashed, Chelsea and Manchester City. While Chelsea had already played the final twice in its history winning once, this was the first opportunity for Manchester City to win the long-desired trophy. \nAlthough the Citizens were considered the favorites, Chelsea won the match and could be considered the best team in the world. They confirmed it twice more - first by beating Europa League winners Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup and then by dominating the Club World Cup in February 2022 as well. \nJust 12 days after winning that trophy for the first time in the club’s history, things began to happen that turned Chelsea’s fortunes completely around. \nRussia invaded Ukraine and Europe was left in shock. Within days, countries began to impose sanctions on Russia. That also included the UK. The government decided to seize or restrict access to the assets of many oligarchs who lived or did business in the country. One of them was Roman Abramovich, who was forced to sell his most famous asset he owned for almost 20 years, Chelsea Football Club.\nJump ahead more than two years. Chelsea are drowning in Premier League mediocrity, with a title or even Champions League spots fight in sight.\nGRAPH RANKING\nA group of businessmen led by Todd Boehly, an American businessman and co-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, took over the club. Chelsea still managed to finish the 21/22 season with dignity and finish third, but then came the downfall.\nIn the first full season under new management, Chelsea finished 12th. This was the worst finish in their Premier League history. The new ownership first got rid of the club’s management and then of coach Tuchel, who won the previously mentioned international trophies with “The Blues”. Two more coaches, Graham Potter and then club legend Frank Lampard, coached the team in the 22/23 season.\nGRAPH WIN PERCENTAGE\nChelsea won only 28.9 percent of their games that year. It was the worst-ever result Chelsea had in the history of the Premier League. \nAt the beginning of the new season, the management decided to hire a new coach, former Tottenham or PSG coach Mauricio Pochettino. Like his predecessor, new ownership supported him with a huge transfer budget. \nBy the end of the summer of 2023, Boehly had already spent around £1 billion in charge of the club. World champion Enzo Fernandez, striker Romelu Lukaku, and midfielder Moises Caicedo are just some of the few new players who have joined Chelsea. These three in particular cost over £100 million each (Lukaku is no longer even in the team and is playing on a loan in Italy).\nBoehly’s management decided to buy mainly young players. They are so young that Chelsea have the youngest squad in the entire Premier League. \nTABLE AGE\nSame as the previous year, Pochettino’s team has been struggling all season, both against the big teams and against those from the bottom of the table. Against the top six teams this season, “The Blues” have only managed to win two games. They won 4-1 at Tottenham and beat Manchester United 4-3 at home.\nHowever, in the next 4 matches, they should have scored more goals than the opponent and won them. But they didn’t.\nTABLE TOP6\nBut Chelsea couldn’t win against the worst-ever sides in the Premier League as well. For example, dead-last Sheffield United have a single point in their last five games. And that was for a 2-2 draw with Chelsea. Given the expected goals, Sheffield should have even won the game. Or the game at Luton, who are playing in the Premier League for the first time ever, which Chelsea won, but statistically should have lost. \nTABLE BOTTOM6\nChelsea are struggling to convert chances to some extent. It has scored XX goals, more than Manchester United, for example, but it should have scored XX goals in total, more than Tottenham and Aston Villa, who are fighting for the crucial fourth position that secures a place in next year’s Champions League season.\nXG\nBut Pochettino’s team is much worse off defensively. Only 7 teams have conceded more goals this season. Apart from West Ham, all of them are struggling to save or at least are among the worst teams in the whole league. Chelsea should have conceded about 8 goals less. However, all the teams who have negative xGA are the teams from the second half of the Premier League table. \nXGA\nGetting that many goals was not at all typical for Chelsea. “The Blues” still hold the record for the fewest goals conceded in a Premier League season. In the 2004-2005 title season, Mourinho’s then-team conceded a hard-to-believe 15 goals in 38 games.\n\n\n\nChildren usually ask the players after the game for a jersey with signs made. This boy begged the players to fight for their jersey during the Arsenal game.\n\n\nPochettino’s team, meanwhile, is at XX goals. And it’s not even the end of the season. Chelsea have 3 more games to record the worst season defensively of the so-called “Big 6” (which contains Manchester United and City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham, and Chelsea), considered to be the best clubs in the league.\nGOALS CONCEDED\nHow is it possible that Chelsea are not doing that badly? Cole Palmer exists.\nOn the last day of the summer 2023 transfer window, Chelsea decided to buy the then-not-so-famous youngster from Manchester City. In doing so, they probably saved their season a little bit.\nPalmer scored XX goals and assisted XX more. \nPALMER1\nBefore the April game against Arsenal, Palmer got sick and was unable to play.\n\n\n\nCole Palmer\n\n\n “It is a good challenge if Palmer is not available tomorrow. It’s a good challenge for his teammates or those in a similar position,” Pochettino said before the game.\n“If I were them, I would be motivated to go there tomorrow and show that this is Chelsea Football Club, not Cole Palmer Football Club,” he added.\nChelsea lost 5-0, the worst defeat by a city rival in Premier League history.\nPALMER2.\nThe young Englishman has contributed to XX% of Chelsea’s goals this season. If we took away all these contributions, Chelsea would be in the relegation zone.\nHowever, it should be noted that this statistic can be misleading. Palmer converted XX penalties, which Chelsea would probably have kicked as well. Moreover, someone else would have been on the pitch instead of him, so this statistic cannot be taken 100% seriously.  But it still says a lot about the dependence of Pochettino’s team on one player.\n\n\n\nChelsea without Cole Palmer according to Sky Bet.\n\n\nSo it’s not to say that this year’s team is clearly the worst. For example, last year’s team had an even lower win percentage and scored fewer goals. The 1996 and 2016 teams won only 3 out of 10 games. This year’s team, on the other hand, has a much worse defensive record and so far won 4 out of 10 games on average. \nPochettino and Boehly can thank Palmer in particular for not being worse off… They are still among the worst though."
